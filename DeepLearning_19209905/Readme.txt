## Deep learning project - Traffic Sign Recognition
## author :Zairui Zhang 19209905


## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to classify traffic signs from images. Utilizing modern CNN architectures and image preprocessing techniques, the project seeks to achieve high accuracy in recognizing diverse traffic signs.

## Key Features
- **Image Preprocessing**: Implements several preprocessing steps including normalization, data equalization, brightness adjustment, and rotational correction to prepare images for training.
-**CNN**: Traditional architechture like Lenet5 and more complex CNN are provided in code second part. With hyperparameter in several attemps that final parameter are shows in model.summary().
- **Model Evaluation**: Detailed evaluation on a held-out test set to assess generalization.
